<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

> Educational Purposes: New developers can study my codebase to learn about Jetpack Compose, Firebase integration, and modern Android development practices.

> Practice Project: Use it as a practice project to improve their skills in Kotlin, UI design, and backend integration.

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

- Ensure you have Android Studio installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official website.

- Make sure you have Git installed to clone the repository.

### Setup

-Open a terminal or command prompt.

-Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.

-Run the following command to clone your repository:
  git clone https://github.com/Davidkinyanjui/Final_project

### Install

Install this project with:
  - Launch Android Studio.
  - Click on “Open an existing Android Studio project” or “File” > “Open”.
  - Select the directory where you cloned your repository.


### Configure Firebase

To Configure Firebase, do the following:
  - If you haven’t already, create a Firebase project on the Firebase Console.
  - Add your Android app to the project and follow the setup instructions.
  - Download the google-services.json file from Firebase and place it in the app module of your project.

Build and Run:
  - Wait for Android Studio to sync the project and download necessary dependencies.
  - Connect an Android device (physical device or emulator) to your computer.
  - Click the “Run” button (green triangle) in Android Studio to build and install the app on your device.
  -Choose the target device when prompted.

Explore the App:
  - Once the app is installed, open it on your device.
  - Navigate through the screens, explore the coffee menu, and place sample orders.
  - Test features like authentication (if implemented), database interactions, and UI responsiveness.
    
Customization:
  - Customize the app by adding your coffee shop’s branding, logo, and colors.
  - Update the menu items, descriptions, and prices to match your actual coffee shop offerings.

Learn and Modify:
  - Study the codebase to understand how Jetpack Compose components are used.
  - Explore ViewModel architecture, navigation, and Firebase integration.
  - Make modifications as needed for your specific use case.


### Run tests

To run tests, do the following command:

- Write unit tests and UI tests to ensure the app’s functionality works as 
   expected.

- Use tools like JUnit and Espresso for testing.

- Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation. Here’s how to write and run unit tests for your app:

Create a Test Class:
   - In your project, create a new directory (usually named test) under the src folder.
   - Inside this directory, create a Kotlin class for your unit tests. For example, CoffeeShopViewModelTest.
     
Write Test Methods:
   - Define test methods within your test class.
   - Use JUnit annotations (@Test, @Before, @After, etc.) to set up and execute tests.
   - Test various scenarios, such as ViewModel logic, data transformations, or utility functions.
     
Mock Dependencies:
   - Use mock objects or dependency injection to isolate the component you’re testing.
   - For example, if you’re testing a ViewModel, mock the repository or data source.
     
Run Tests:
   - Right-click on your test class and select “Run” to execute the tests.
   - Observe the test results in the Android Studio console.
     

### Deployment

You can deploy this project using:
  - Deploy your app to an emulator or a physical device for testing.
    
  - Once you’re satisfied, consider publishing it to the Google Play Store.


When Deploying your app on the Google Play Console it will involves several steps. Let’s walk through them:

1 Create a Google Developer Account:
  - If you haven’t already, create a Google Play Developer account by paying a one-time fee of $25.
  - Navigate to the Google Play Console.
    
2 Create Your App:
  - Log in to the Google Play Console.
  - Select “All apps” and click “Create app”.
  - Choose a default language and provide the name of your app as you want it to appear on Google Play.
  - Specify whether your app is an app or a game, and whether it’s free or paid.
  - Add an email address for user inquiries related to your app.

3 Set Up Your App:
  - After creating your app, you’ll be guided through essential steps:
  - Content Details: Provide information about your app’s content.
  - Store Listing: Enter details like app description, screenshots, and promotional graphics.
  - App Release: Manage pre-release testing, version management, and promotion.
  - Launch Your App: Make your app available to users on Google Play.

4 Upload Your App Bundle:
  - Build an Android App Bundle (AAB) using Android Studio.
  - Sign the release version of your app.
  - Upload the AAB to the Google Play Console.
  - Google Play will generate APKs optimized for different device configurations.

5 Test Your App Internally:
  - Use the app bundle explorer in the Play Console to inspect APKs generated from your bundle.
  - Test your app on different devices and configurations.

6 Publish Your App:
  - Once you’re satisfied with testing, click “Review” in the Play Console.
  - Review your app’s details and settings.
  - Click “Start rollout to production” to publish your app.
